# python introduction 
# What is python?
* python is a high level,general purpose programing language.
* It was created by Guido van Rosum and release in 1919 at CWI Netherland. 
* It is dynamic.
# Why to use python?
* Simple & easy to learn 
* platform independent
* Free and open source
* Interpreted (bytecode-compiled) 
* Rich library support(abour 1 lakh fourty thousands )
* Embeddable & extensible
* Portable
* Robust
# Where to use python?
* Web framework & applications
* GUI-based network applications (Graphical user interface)
* Graphic design,image processing aplications,Games and scientific computational applications
* Data science,Data visualization
* IOT (Internet of things)
* Database development
# Conditional statements 
* if statement 
* if...else statement
* if...elif...else statement
* Nested if statement 
# Range () Functions
* returns a series of numbers
* Works only with integer arguments
* step value can not be zero 
# Syntax
       range(start,stop,step):
# for loop with range (stop)
* generates a sequence of integers starting from 0 to stop -1
# for loop with range ( start,stop)
* generates a sequence of integers starting from start to stop -1
# for loop with range(start,stop,step)
* generates a sequence of integers starting from start,incremented by step and stopped at stop -1
# Indentation
# Basics of Indentation
Indentation is a leading whitespace before any statement in python.
# Purpose of indentation 
* It not only improves readibility but helps in indicating a block of code.
# Rules for indentation 
* minimum one space is necessory to represent an indented statement.
* The first line of the python code cannot have indentation.
* Indentation is mondatory to define a block of code. 
* The number of space must be uniform.
# python keywords
A Python keyword is a word that serves a specific function in Python.
# How to Identify Python Keywords
* Use an IDE With Syntax Highlighting
* Use Code in a REPL to Check Keywords
* Look for a SyntaxError
# Python Keywords and Their Usage
* Value Keywords: True, False, None
* Operator Keywords: and, or, not, in, is
* Control Flow Keywords: if, elif, else
* Iteration Keywords: for, while, break, continue, else
* Structure Keywords: def, class, with, as, pass, lambda
* Returning Keywords: return, yield
* Import Keywords: import, from, as
* Exception-Handling Keywords: try, except, raise, finally, else, assert
* Asynchronous Programming Keywords: async, await
